     This method opens a file picker dialog to allow the user to select an image file.
    If an image is selected, it is displayed in the `UploadedImage` view.
    If any error occurs during the image upload, an alert is shown with the error message.

    This method checks if both an image and a caption have been provided by the user.
    If both are present, it simulates saving the memory (e.g., to a database or other storage),
    displays a confirmation alert to the user, and then clears the input fields and image display.
    If either the image or caption is missing, it shows an error alert asking the user to provide both.
